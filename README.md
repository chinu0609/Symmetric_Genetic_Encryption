## Symmetric key encryption using genetic algorithm


This is a implementation of a research paper on assymmetric key encryption using genetic algorithm.
I have implemented a symmetric one because I was unable to understand the formula for private key generation,
once I know it I will make changes in it.

And the research paper I used is in the repo.
